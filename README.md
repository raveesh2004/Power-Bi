<h2>Employee Data Analysis</h2>

<h3>Data Preparation</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Create a table named "Employee" with the following columns:
    <ul>
      <li>empid</li>
      <li>gender</li>
      <li>department</li>
      <li>salary</li>
      <li>country</li>
      <li>year_of_joining</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Connect the "Employee" table to the corresponding data file.</li>
  <li>Remove any rows with missing values in the "gender" and "department" columns to ensure data consistency.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Data Visualization</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Extract the "year_of_joining" column from the "Employee" table.</li>
  <li>Visualize the number of employees with respect to their years of experience in the company using a suitable chart type (e.g., bar chart, line chart).</li>
  <li>Analyze the distribution of employees based on their tenure in the company.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Self-Join using Power Query</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Perform a self-join on the "Employee" table using Power Query.</li>
  <li>Explore the resulting table and identify any interesting relationships or patterns.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Salary Aggregation and Visualization</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Aggregate the salary data based on gender using Power Query.</li>
  <li>Create a pie chart to visualize the salary distribution across different genders.</li>
  <li>Analyze the salary disparity, if any, between genders.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Machine Learning Result Visualization in Power BI</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Choose a machine learning algorithm and a dataset of your choice.</li>
  <li>Train and evaluate the machine learning model using the selected algorithm and dataset.</li>
  <li>Export the results of the machine learning model to a format compatible with Power BI (e.g., CSV, Excel).</li>
  <li>Import the machine learning results into Power BI.</li>
  <li>Create visualizations to represent the key findings and performance metrics of the machine learning model.</li>
  <li>Analyze the visualizations to gain insights into the model's performance and interpretability.</li>
</ol>

<p>This project aims to demonstrate the power of Power View and Power Query in Excel for data analysis and visualization, as well as the integration of machine learning results with Power BI for visual exploration and interpretation.</p>
